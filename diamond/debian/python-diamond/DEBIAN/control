Description: A schema-driven interface for writing XML documents
 Diamond is a dynamic schema-driven graphical user interface for writing
 XML documents. The interface is automatically generated from a schema
 written in RELAX NG describing an XML language. The interface is optimised
 for configuring models for solving problems in computational mechanics,
 though the technology is generic to any sort of XML document creation.
